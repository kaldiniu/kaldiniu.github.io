After finishing school, I completed vocational training and later obtained a university degree in economics. My academic education includes a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a Specialist diploma in Finance. Both degrees are officially recognized in Germany. After several years of professional experience as an economist and later as a self-employed content manager and online marketing specialist, I decided to change my career path towards IT and software development.",
